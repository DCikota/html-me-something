                <h2>Arby's</h2>
                <p>I worked as a team member at Arby's from September 2015 through July 2016, where I learned how to work in a fast paced environment, as well as,
                    bettering my customer service skills.

                <h2>Missouri University of Science and Technology</h2>
                <p>I started school at Missouri University of Science and Technology 
                    in August 2016 and graduated in December 2018 with a bachelors in physics
                    and a minor in mathematics. While enrolled there, I joined the physics honor society
                    called the Society of Physics Students and I joined an astronomy group called 
                    STARs. In each of these groups we did fun group activities involving 
                    physics.

                <h2>Undergraduate Research</h2>
                <p>At Missouri University of Science and Technology I worked as an undergraduate researcher
                    for a professor Dr. Michael Schulz in his atomic laboratory. Where, along side of graduate
                    researchers, we studied few body collisions.

                <p>During my time in the laboratory, I assisted with three projects, my job during those experiments included aligning
                    the proton beam correctly so that after colliding with the various particles, with which we worked
                    with, it would also hit the projectile sensor at the end of the accelerator. Another job of mine 
                    was to look through the data that our program collected to filter through it all and find only the 
                    data useable for our research. More information can be found

                <h2>Future Plans</h2>
                <p>After I finish LaunchCode, I plan to find a job as a programmer. I am leaning towards doing more
                    data science because I still want to continue in the field of science, building models and looking through
                    data and trying to understand it all.
