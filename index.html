        <h2>Arby's</h2>
        <p>I worked as a team member at Arby's from September 2015 through July 2016, where I learned how to work in a fast paced environment.</p>

        <h2>Undergraduate Research</h2>
        <p>At Missouri University of Science and Technology I worked as an undergraduate researcher
           for a professor Dr. Michael Schulz in his atomic laboratory. Where, along side of graduate
           researchers, we studied few body collisions.

        <p>During my time in the laboratory, I assisted with three projects, my job during those experiments included aligning
           the proton beam correctly so that after colliding with the various particles, with which we worked
           with, it would also hit the projectile sensor at the end of the accelerator. Another job of mine 
           was to look through the data that our program collected to filter through it all and find only the 
           data useable for our research. More information can be found
